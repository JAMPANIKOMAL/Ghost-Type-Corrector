# Testing the Ghost Type Corrector Extension

## ‚úÖ Model Conversion Complete!

The model has been successfully converted to TensorFlow.js Graph Model format (24.37 MB).

## üìã Testing Steps

### 1. Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the folder: `C:\Users\jampa\Videos\Ghost Type Corrector\extension`

### 2. Verify Extension Loaded

‚úÖ Check that "Ghost Type Corrector" appears in the extensions list  
‚úÖ Check that there are **no errors** in the extension card  
‚úÖ The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### 3. Test on a Webpage

1. Go to any webpage with text inputs (e.g., Google, Gmail, Facebook)
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Type in any text input field on the page
5. Watch the console for messages:
   ```
   Sandbox: Script loaded, waiting for initialization message...
   Content Script: Initializing...
   Content Script: Received sandbox loaded signal
   Sandbox: Initializing AI resources...
   Sandbox: Tokenizer config loaded successfully
   Sandbox: Loading TensorFlow.js model as GraphModel...
   Sandbox: Model loaded successfully
   Sandbox: Model warmup complete
   Sandbox: Ready signal sent to content script
   Content Script: AI Model is ready!
   ```

### 4. Test Autocorrection

Type some text with typos in any input field. The extension should automatically correct them as you type.

**Example typos to test:**
- `teh` ‚Üí `the`
- `recieve` ‚Üí `receive`
- `seperate` ‚Üí `separate`
- `occured` ‚Üí `occurred`

## üîç Debugging

If you see errors:

### Console Errors

1. **Check the Console tab** in DevTools for any red error messages
2. Look for messages starting with:
   - `Sandbox:` - Model loading issues
   - `Content Script:` - Communication issues
   - `Override:` - Input detection issues

### Common Issues

**Error: "Failed to fetch"**
- The extension can't load the model files
- Check that `extension/model/model.json` exists
- Check file permissions

**Error: "Model signature undefined"**
- The model format might be incorrect
- Check that all `.bin` files are present in `extension/model/`

**Error: "chrome.runtime is undefined"**
- Make sure you're testing on a real webpage, not on `chrome://` pages
- Extensions don't work on Chrome's internal pages

## üìä Model Files

The following files should be in `extension/model/`:
- ‚úÖ `model.json` (105 KB)
- ‚úÖ `group1-shard1of4.bin` (4.19 MB)
- ‚úÖ `group1-shard2of4.bin` (4.19 MB)
- ‚úÖ `group1-shard3of4.bin` (4.19 MB)
- ‚úÖ `group1-shard4of4.bin` (139 KB)
- ‚úÖ Multiple other shard files
- **Total: 24.37 MB**

## üéØ Expected Behavior

1. **On page load:**
   - Extension injects content script
   - Sandbox iframe created
   - Model loads in background (~2-5 seconds)
   - Console shows "AI Model is ready!"

2. **When typing:**
   - Your input is sent to the AI model
   - Model predicts corrections
   - Corrections applied automatically (if different from input)

3. **Performance:**
   - First correction may be slow (model warmup)
   - Subsequent corrections should be fast (<100ms)

## üêõ Still Having Issues?

Check the full console output and look for specific error messages. The sandbox script has detailed logging at each step.
