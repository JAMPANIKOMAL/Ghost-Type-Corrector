# Ghost Type Corrector

A next-generation, AI-powered browser extension that provides truly invisible, contextual autocorrection, bringing the seamless "mobile keyboard" experience to your desktop browser.

This project is an advanced rebuild of an initial prototype: https://github.com/JAMPANIKOMAL/invisible-autocorrect-extension, replacing the original frequency-dictionary "brain" with a character-level, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network.

## Core Features

- **Invisible Correction:** No distracting popups, underlines, or suggestions. Typos are corrected instantly and silently the moment you press the spacebar.

- **Contextual AI:** The model understands context, allowing it to fix both spelling mistakes ("wrod") and grammatical/contextual errors ("I went too the store").

- **Mobile-Style Undo:** The signature feature: if the AI makes an unwanted correction, simply press Backspace once to instantly undo the correction and revert to your original typing.

- **Browser-Native Feel:** The extension disables the browser's default red-squiggle spellcheck, providing a clean, seamless, and native-feeling typing experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

Choose GPU (faster) or CPU (universal):

**GPU Training (Recommended):**
```powershell
conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml
conda activate ghost-corrector-gpu
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
```

**CPU Training:**
```powershell
conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml
conda activate ghost-corrector-cpu
```

### 2. Train the Model

```powershell
cd ai_model

# Step 1: Prepare data
python 01_data_preprocessing.py

# Step 2: Train model (5-50 minutes depending on hardware)
python 02_model_training.py

# Step 3: Convert to TensorFlow.js
python 03_model_conversion.py
```
